1) Dynamic Memory Allocation is a way in which the size of a data structure can be changed during the runtime.

2)Memory assigned to program in a tipical architecture can be broken down into four segments:
1)CODE
2)Static / globle veriable.
3)Stack
4)Heap

3)When we allocate the Memory Dynamically using (DMA) then memory will allocate in Heap
and we use heap use without freeing memory they overall memory usage keep increasing and.
These sisution is cause memory leak . 

4) To avoid memory leak ie the progrmmer should always free Allocated memory when not need.
